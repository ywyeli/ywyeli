I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

My research pursues to build robust 3D perception models for robots across domains and scenarios, while requiring minimum human annotations.

I am open to discussions and collaborations in 3D scene perception and generation. Feel free to drop me an email if you find our research backgrounds a potential match.
